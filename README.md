# AudioConverter
The project consists of a program that converts WAV audio files to raw PCM format with G711 encoding, with a choice of three different sample rates: 8000, 16000 and 44100 Hz. In addition, the script can also generate WAV files as output.

The program takes audio files in WAV format as input. The user can choose the sampling frequency from three available options (8000, 16000, 44100 Hz). The audio file then undergoes a resampling process, which adjusts the sample rate of the input file to the user's choice. Next, the file is converted to raw PCM format G711.
